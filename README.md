# ImmunoQuest - WBC Classification 🏆  

This repository contains our solution for **ImmunoQuest**, a deep learning hackathon where we secured **3rd place among 48 teams**. The task was to classify **White Blood Cells (WBCs)** using deep learning techniques.  

## 🧪 Approach  
1. **Initial Model:** We first trained a **VGG16-based model**, but it resulted in overfitting.  
2. **Final Model:** We switched to **MobileNetV2**, which significantly improved generalization.  
3. **Results:** Achieved **~84% accuracy** on both training and validation sets.  


## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImmunoQuest-WBC-Classification.git
   ```
2. Get the file:
   ```
   team_immuno_solvers.ipynb
   ```
3. Build your ownn model by tuning the hyperparameters.
